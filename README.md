# Sydney Restaurant Data Analysis & Modeling
This two-part project analyzes restaurant data in Sydney to uncover insights about pricing, ratings, cuisines, and success indicators. It uses Python for analysis, Tableau for visualization, and Docker for reproducibility. The project was completed as part of my Master’s in Data Science coursework.

## Project Structure
Notebook	Purpose
Code_partA.ipynb	Reading, cleaning, and exploring the restaurant dataset
Code_partB.ipynb	Building machine learning models and drawing insights

## What I Learned
This project helped me grow in multiple areas of data science:

- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding, scaling, and dealing with categorical features.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Using visual tools like seaborn and matplotlib to analyze ratings, cuisines, and pricing.

- Feature Engineering: Creating new variables to improve model performance.

- Modeling: Applying regression and classification techniques to predict restaurant price levels or success.

- Visualization: Building interactive Tableau dashboards for business-level storytelling.

- Reproducibility: Using Docker to containerize and run the project reliably across machines.

## Dataset
The dataset contains detailed information on restaurants in Sydney. It is saved as "zomato_df_final_data.csv" inside teh folder "data".

Source: Dataset used as part of a university assignment 

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Languages: Python

- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, joblib

- Visualization: Tableau

- Deployment/Environment: Docker

- Other Skills: Data wrangling, feature encoding, scaling, clustering, model evaluation
